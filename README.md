# JavaTetris

I developed a tetris game using the JavaFX library. 

Controls:

- Up arrow key: change shape of tetris block

- Right arrow key: move tetris block to the right

- Left arrow key: move tetris block to the left

- Down arrow key: move tetris block down

- Spacebar: Causes tetris block to fall to the top of the tile heap or bottom of screen

-

I created the pause and play icons myself, but I borrowed the refresh icon from https://icons8.com. 

You can pause the game at any time and restart it when you want.
